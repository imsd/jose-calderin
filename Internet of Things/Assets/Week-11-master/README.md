	+ An implementation of Tracery for easy in-browser editing

### Tracery Tidbits

+ `#something#` makes a category (the hash marks)
	+ `.a` at the end of a category figures out a/an article for you
		+ example: `I'm #profession.a#` would output `"I'm a golfer" or "I'm an architect"`
+ `.capitalize` capitalize the first letter in the word
+ Lists in JSON are created like this:
```
"profession": [
	"poet",
	"teacher",
	"scientist",
	"sailor",
	"golfer",
	"urban planner",
	"programmer"
]
```
