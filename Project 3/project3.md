Project 3
For the project 3 what i would like to do is take viewership from different streamer on twitch when they are on and off how the scene would i would like to illustrate it by have pillars representing the individual streamers  the pillars would be made by blocks each block would represent from 100 to 500 viewers watching still haven't decided they each block will change color when the viewership has passed it when the streamer is off the pillar will be blank. The data i would need is viewer watching the stream at that time i still haven't decided what streamer i would use  but i narrowed two use 3 streamers. For this project it will be real time data cause i'm taking the viewership that watching the stream while it's on.
