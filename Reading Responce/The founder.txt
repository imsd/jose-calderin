The founder is game where you can create your own company and be able to run every 
aspect of it. There many thing that you can control for example you can decide if 
you company is gonna either focus on hardware or software. Also can hire your employees 
from different ways like you can have a job fair or have a recommendation and offer them
yr wage also coming up with new thing on research expanding the company and promoting it 
to. Something that I found fun was competing with other companies trying to have larger 
influence on the market. The thing I found really difficult was having a good revenue my 
company struggle really hard the board was raging at my way ofrunning thing.
